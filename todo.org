   STATUS: Should be fixed now, but not 100% sure.
* IRC [2/2]
** DONE Messages get split up. 
   This needs to be fixed ASAP, and probably should be part of proper IRC protocol hanlding.
** DONE Add proper IRC protocol message hanlding
   Parsing the IRC protocol messages in the method for extracting user messages is embarassing.
* Optimization [/]
** Remove chat logs from working memory on save
   They just eat too much RAM, and there's no point in keeping all the chat logs in memory the entire time. Get them out of memory when a save happens, and just load them back in from secondary storage if they need to be searched.
* URL handling [0/3]
** TODO Recognize URLs during message parsing
** TODO Ignore symbols that are URLs
** TODO Remove URL symbols from already existing dictionaries
* Interface [0/3]
** TODO Take channel and dict name as command line arguments
** TODO Handle multiple chat streams at once
   Make sure each stream stays within its own dictionary.
** TODO Make GUI interface [0/3]
